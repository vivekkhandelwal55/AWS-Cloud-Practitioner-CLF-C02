# AWS Batch

- fully managed batch processing at any scale
- it will launch EC2 instance or spot instance to match the workload requirement
- it uses EC2 but it is managed by AWS.
- it has start and stop mechanism(opposite to continuous )
- you just summit and schedule, rest it will handle
- batch jobs run docker images which run on ECS
- it is helpful for cost optimisation and less overhead of infrastructure


# Batch vs Lambda


| Lambda                                | Batch                                                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| There is maximum time limit of 15mins | There is no time limit in batch                            |
| very less enviorment supported        | as docker images run by ecs, it can support any enviorment |
| limited temporary disk space          | can use ec2 instance store. ebs                            |
| serverless                            | uses ec2 instance/ spot instances managed by aws           |
