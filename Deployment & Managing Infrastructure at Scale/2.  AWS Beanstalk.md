 - developers do not want to manage infrastructure they just want to deploy code.
 - Beanstalk provides a developer friendly way to deploy code on AWS.
 - it uses all the components which we have seen of till now
 -  EC2, ASG, RDS, S3 etc..


 - beanstalk is free but it will cost the underlying resources used.
 - **Beanstalk = Platform as Service**


#### Responsibility 

Beanstalk handles : 
- instance configuration/ os 
- deployment strategy can be configured but handled by beanstalk
- Capacity provisioning
- load balancing and auto scaling
- Health monitoring


**For Developer, he just have to handle the application code**

>[! Note: Beanstalk also provides the health monitoring of underlying resources]
